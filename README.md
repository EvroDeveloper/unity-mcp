# Unity/Marrow MCP Package

A Unity package that enables seamless communication between Unity and Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude Desktop via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This server acts as a bridge, allowing Unity to send commands to and receive responses from MCP-compliant tools, empowering developers to automate workflows, manipulate assets, and control the Unity Editor programmatically. Includes extra functionality for use with the MarrowSDK, to easily create Pallets, Crates, and DataCards.

Welcome to the initial release of this open-source project! Whether you're looking to integrate LLMs into your Unity workflow or contribute to an exciting new tool, we’re thrilled to have you here.

## Overview

The Unity MCP Server provides a bidirectional communication channel between Unity (via C#) and a Python server, enabling:

- **Asset Management**: Create, import, and manipulate Unity assets programmatically.
- **Scene Control**: Manage scenes, objects, and their properties.
- **Material Editing**: Modify materials and their properties.
- **Script Integration**: View, create, and update Unity scripts.
- **Editor Automation**: Control Unity Editor functions like undo, redo, play, and build.
- **MarrowSDK Integration**: Create Pallets, Crates, and DataCards

This project is perfect for developers who want to leverage LLMs to enhance their Unity projects or automate repetitive tasks.

## Installation

Getting started is simple! Follow these steps to add the Unity MCP Server to your project:

### Unity Package

1. **Download the Package**  
   Add via the Unity package manager using this link
  ```text
  https://github.com/EvroDeveloper/unity-marrow-mcp.git
  ```

2. **Add to Unity**  
   - Open Unity and navigate to `Window > Package Manager`.
   - Click the `+` button and select `Add package from disk...`.
   - Locate the downloaded package and select the `package.json` file.

### Python Environment

1. **Prerequisites**  
   Ensure you have:
   - **Python** (version 3.7 or higher) installed. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **`uv`** installed for managing Python dependencies. Install it via:
     ```bash
     pip install uv
     ```

2. **Set Up the Python Server**  
   - Navigate to the `Python` directory within the package (e.g., `Assets/MCPServer/Python`).
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     uv venv
     uv pip install -e .
     ```

## Configuration

To connect the MCP Server to tools like Claude Desktop or Cursor:

1. **Open the Unity MCP Window**  
   In Unity, go to `Window > Unity MCP` to open the editor window.

2. **Configure Your Tools**  
   - In the Unity MCP window, you’ll see buttons to configure **Claude Desktop** or **Cursor**.
   - Click the appropriate button and follow the on-screen instructions to set up the integration.

3. **Verify Server Status**  
   - Check the server status in the Unity MCP window. It will display:
     - **Unity Bridge**: Should show "Running" when active.
     - **Python Server**: Should show "Connected" (green) when successfully linked.

## Usage

Once configured, you can use the MCP Server to interact with LLMs directly from Unity or Python. Here are a couple of examples:

### Creating a Cube in the Scene

```python
# Send a command to create a cube at position (0, 0, 0)
create_primitive(primitive_type="Cube", position=[0, 0, 0])
```

### Changing a Material’s Color

```python
# Set a material’s color to red (RGBA: 1, 0, 0, 1)
set_material_color(material_name="MyMaterial", color=[1, 0, 0, 1])
```

## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common fixes:

- **Unity Bridge Not Running**  
  Ensure the Unity Editor is open and the MCP window is active. Restart Unity if needed.

- **Python Server Not Connected**  
  - Verify the Python server is running (`python server.py` in the `Python` directory).
  - Check `config.json` (in `Assets/MCPServer`) for correct port settings (default: `unity_port: 6400`, `mcp_port: 6500`).
  - Ensure `uv` and dependencies are installed correctly.

- **Configuration Issues with Claude Desktop or Cursor**  
  Confirm the paths and settings in the configuration dialog match your tool’s installation.
